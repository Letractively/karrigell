#summary How to pass parameters to a script

= Introduction =

The user enters data in an HTML form. Each field in the form is identified by a name ; the form itself has an argument "action" to specify the url of the script that will handle the submitted data

In Karrigell, the "action" is a function in a script, and the form names are the arguments of this function

= Example =

{{{
def index():
    # build the HTML form
    form = FORM(action="show")
    form <= INPUT(name="foo")
    form <= INPUT(Type="submit",value="Ok")
    return HTML(BODY(form))

def show(foo):
    return B(foo)
}}}

In index() we build the form, with an attribute action set to "show", the name of the function in the same script that will manage the form

This function takes a single argument, foo, the same as the name of the only INPUT field in the form. It returns the submitted data in bold character (using the HTML tag B)
