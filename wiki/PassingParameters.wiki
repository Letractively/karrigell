#summary How to pass parameters to a script

= Introduction =

The user enters data in an HTML form. Each field in the form is identified by a name ; the form itself has an argument "action" to specify the url of the script that will handle the submitted data

In Karrigell, the "action" is a function in a script, and the form names are the arguments of this function

= Basic example =

{{{
def index():
    # build the HTML form
    form = FORM(action="show")
    form <= INPUT(name="foo")
    form <= INPUT(Type="submit",value="Ok")
    return HTML(BODY(form))

def show(foo):
    return B(foo)
}}}

In index() we build the form, with an attribute action set to "show", the name of the function in the same script that will manage the form

This function takes a single argument, foo, the same as the name of the only INPUT field in the form. It returns the submitted data in bold character (using the HTML tag B)

Sometimes the form has fields that may or may not be filled by the user, such as check buttons, radiobuttons, options in a SELECT tag, etc

In this case the matching value may be set or not. In this case, the function can use the usual Python syntax for arbitrary argument list, and test if a specific field has been sent :

{{{
def manage(**kw):
    if 'foo' in kw:
        (...)
}}}
