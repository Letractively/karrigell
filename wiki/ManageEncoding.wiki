#summary How to specify the encoding for a web document

[http://code.google.com/p/karrigell/wiki/Home Home] / [http://code.google.com/p/karrigell/wiki/HowTos Howtos]

The encoding of a page can be set by the built-in name ENCODING. It will define the Content-type header sent by the server

It affects both the encoding used to encode the data submitted by a form, and the encoding used to transform the bytestring received on the network connection to a string printed in the browser

Here is an example :
{{{
ENCODING = "utf-8"
 
def index(**kw):
    form = FORM(action="show",method="POST")
    form <= INPUT(name="src")
    form <= INPUT(Type="submit",value="Ok")
    return HTML(BODY(form))
 
def show(src):
    return src
}}}
By default, ENCODING is set to sys.getdefaultencoding()
