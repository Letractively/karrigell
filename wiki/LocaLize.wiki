Localizing a script means that text can be displayed in different languages, without having to write a script per language

In Karrigell, this is performed by the function `_`(_string_) (underscore). A string is translated if the translations database has a translation for _string_ in one the languages found in the browsers language preferences, sent as the "accept-language" header

The translations database is defined as the attribute <font color="#338" size="2"><b>translations_db</b></font> of the application (see ApplicationSettings). Karrigell provides the class <font color="#338" size="2"><b>`SQLiteTranslationDb`</b></font> in module <font color="#336633"><b>admin_db</b></font>. The SQLite database is initialized with its path in the filesystem

= Web interface =

The distribution provides a script for the administrator to edit translations online. It is available from the home page once the administrator is logged in

The script browses all the scripts in the application root directory, and underlines those that have strings to translate. Clicking on a such script shows all these strings, and prompts for a translation in the first language found in the browsers preference

= Customize the translation engine =

The <font color="#338" size="2"><b>translations_db</b></font> application attribute can be set to any object supporting the following method :

  * <font color="#338" size="2"><b>get_translation(_src,language_)</b></font> : returns the translation of the string _src_ in the specified _language_. The language is a two-character string such as "fr" for French, "en" for English, etc (see ISO 639 for a complete list)
