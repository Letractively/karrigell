#summary How to upload files.

Create another script called upload.py :

{{{
def index():
    form = FORM(action="upload",method="post",enctype="multipart/form-data")
    form <= INPUT(Type="file",name="src")
    form <= INPUT(Type="submit",value="Ok")
    return HTML(BODY(form))
 
def upload(src):
    import mimetypes
    gtype,encoding = mimetypes.guess_type(src.filename)
    RESPONSE_HEADERS['Content-type'] = gtype
    data = src.file.read()
    return data
}}}

The function index() looks like the previous example. The changes are the enctype parameter of the FORM, set to "multipart/form-data" ; and the type of the first INPUT field

In the upload function, we receive the argument src. Since it was sent as a file inside a multipart/form-data form, this object has an attribute filename matching the name of the uploaded file ; it also has an attribute file, a file-like object with a method read() that returns bytes.

The Python module mimetypes can guess the type of this file by its extension ; for instance if the uploaded file was a JPEG image, with the extension .jpg, the result of mimetypes.guess_type(src.filename) will be "image/pjpeg"

The line
{{{RESPONSE_HEADERS['Content-type'] = gtype
}}}
