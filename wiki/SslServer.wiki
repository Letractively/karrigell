#summary Using a built-in SSL server

The built-in server can be configured in SSL mode

For this, you must generate a key and certificate file (a file with the extension .pem). You can use OpenSSL for that : the instructions on how to generate such a file are explained in detail on the OpenSSL site

_(Warning : on Windows, once the openssl.exe is installed, you are likely to have a message saying that the configuration file openssl.cnf is not found. You can fix this by adding -config /path/to/openssl/bin/openssl.cfg at the end of the request to create the file)_

The module <font color="#336633"><b>sslserver</b></font> provides the class <font color="#338" size="2"><b>SSLServer</b></font>. Its class attribute <font color="#338" size="2"><b>pem</b></font> must be set to the path of the .pem file. This class is passed to the <font color="#338" size="2"><b>run()</b></font> method of Karrigell

{{{
import Karrigell
import Karrigell.sslserver

# start the SSL web server on port 443 to serve this application
server = Karrigell.sslserver.SSLServer
server.pem = "server.pem" # replace with correct path
Karrigell.run(server=server,port=443)
}}}

This will serve requests like _https://localhost/script_ on port 443
