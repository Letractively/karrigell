#summary Application settings

= Introduction =

The server can run one or several applications. By default, starting the server with

{{{
Karrigell.run()
}}}

means that there is only one application, serving scripts and documents from the directory where the server script stands

This page explains how you can change these default settings

= Creating an application =

An application is described by an instance of a subclass of the class <font color="#363" size="2"><b>`Karrigell.App`</b></font>. Each subclass defines the following attributes :

===root_url===
A string beginning with a forward slash (/), indicates the first part of the urls served by this application. Defaults to "/"

===root_dir===
The directory in the file system to serve scripts and documents from. Defaults to the directory where the server script stands

===session_storage_class===
The class used to manage the storage and retrieval of session objects (see SessionManagement). Defaults to the class <font color="#363" size="2"><b>`FileSessionManagement`</b></font> in module Karrigell.sessions

===users_db===
An object representing the users database. It must have the same interface as the class SQLiteUsersDb in module Karrigell.admin_db

You can use a SQLite users database by specifying its path in the file system :

{{{
users_db = Karrigell.admin_db.SQLiteUsersDB(_db_path_)
}}}

Defaults to None, meaning that there is no users management for this application
