#summary Run the "Hello world" script

Create a new directory. Save this script in a file called "index.py":

{{{
   def index():
      return "Hello world"
}}}

Create another script called server.py:

{{{
   import Karrigell
   Karrigell.run()
}}}

Save server.py in the same folder as index.py, then run it : 

<code>python server.py</code>

This will launch the built-in web server

Finally, in a web browser enter the address _http://localhost/index.py/index_

Congratulations, you just ran your first Karrigell script ! The address _index.py/index_ requested to run the function index() in the script index.py. The value returned by this function is printed in the web browser

In fact, you could have written the url _http://localhost/index.py_ : if no function name is specified, the function index() is run by default, with no argument

And you could even have called _http://localhost_ : if no script is specified, the server searches a script called index.py and if it finds one, it executes its function index()
